Hi! I am Bakshree Mishra and I'm currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer at Intel, where I work on analyzing and accelerating ML algorithms. I have created custom architectures for CNNs as well as traditional ML classifiers, as well as created a Context Aware Voice/NLP agent. I am interested in understanding the underlying computational needs of algorithms and how to best address them.

I completed my undergrad at College of Engineering and Technology, Bhubaneswar and my Masters from National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, majoring in Computer Science. While at NIT Rourkela I spent an incredible year at Intel working on real-time computer vision-based Pedestrian Detection Systems under the supervision of [Prof. Bansidhar Majhi](https://www.nitrkl.ac.in/FProfile.aspx?bmajhi).
