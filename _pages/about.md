Hi! I am Bakshree Mishra and I am a 1st year PhD Student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. My primary area of interest is in computer architecture for next-gen algorithms and computations.

Prior to this, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer as well as IP Logic Design Engineer at Intel, where I worked on analyzing ML algorithms and accelerating them in hardware. I have created custom architectures for CNNs as well as traditional ML classifiers, as well as created a Context Aware Voice/NLP agent. On the hardware side, I have owned and designed modules going into both FPGA and SOCs.

I completed my undergrad at College of Engineering and Technology, Bhubaneswar and my Masters from National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, majoring in Computer Science. My Masters research on Real-time computer vision-based Pedestrian Detection Systems was conducted under the supervision of [Prof. Bansidhar Majhi](https://www.nitrkl.ac.in/FProfile.aspx?bmajhi).
